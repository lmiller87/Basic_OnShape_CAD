### Reflection: 
This was a very simple piece for me to do. Ive done it before in several other engineering classes, the only part was figuring out the basics of OnShape CAD. Hopefully the next pieces get easier and easier for me to do.

### Reflection:
Very simple, I am getting a hang of the new Onshape tools, learned how to use linear pattern on Onshape and other than that very basic part.

### Reflection: Very easy, but a few more difficult conecpts where introduced, like mirroring and chamfers. I had an issue mirroring because I wasn't using a mouse at the time but thats an easy fix problem.
