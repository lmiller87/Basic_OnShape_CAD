### Reflection: 
This was a very simple piece for me to do. Ive done it before in several other engineering classes, the only part was figuring out the basics of OnShape CAD. Hopefully the next pieces get easier and easier for me to do.

### Reflection:
Very simple, I am getting a hang of the new Onshape tools, learned how to use linear pattern on Onshape and other than that very basic part.

### Reflection: 
Very easy, but a few more difficult conecpts where introduced, like mirroring and chamfers. I had an issue mirroring because I wasn't using a mouse at the time but thats an easy fix problem.

### Reflection:
Very easy part if not the easiest. Only problem was gifuring out the dimensions, one of mine turned red and I had to restart the dimensions to solve the problem, and I had aparently previously defined a line which didn't allow me to use smart dimension.

### Reflection:
Hardest one yet, had to figure out how to use the new features such as circular pattern/revolve and fillet on onshape. Other than that no problems.

### Reflection:
Very easy! I learned how to use a merge scope which I thought was cool, other than that very simple stuff.

### Reflection:
Literally the easiest thing I've ever done, all I had to do was use the "use" feature and extrude.

Simple, took two seconds, zero problems.
